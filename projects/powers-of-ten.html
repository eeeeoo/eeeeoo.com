                    This was initially created as the final project for my class at the MIT Media Lab. As a response to the Eames brothers' <i>Powers of Ten</i>, the prompt of the project was to create something that demonstrates how the perspective on something can change across a scale of time, area, population, data, or others.

                    We contemplated on the representation of time by dissecting the chronological transformation of Chinese characters from the original oracle bone script to today’s tech-assisted usage of simplified characters. The evolution of Chinese characters spans from 1500 BCE to 1956, a rich timeline which spans across three powers of ten in years.

              <span class="feature-title">Chinese Language in the Digital Age</span>
              <p>
                Starting with hieroglyphic pictograms carved on oracle bones, Chinese characters continuously evolved around these original forms but maintained the essential integrity. 
                Gradually, the language began to rely on ink, then Pinyin (romanization of the characters based on pronunciation), 
                then technology. Cloud computing predicts the user’s input and voice recognition eliminates the need to learn written word. 
              </p>
              <span class="feature-title">Chinese Written Language</span>
              <p>
                Even though Chinese characters are relatively ubiquitous all around the world, very few people outside of the Chinese cultural tradition are aware of the organic, stunning, 
                and well-documented transformation that the written language has undergone. By retracing steps that occurred over thousands of years, one can clearly see how the modern 
                simplified script is directly descended from its pictographic beginnings &#8212 characters found carved on turtle bones from ancient times. 
              </p>
              <span class="feature-title">Abstracting the Transformation</span>
              <p>
                In a way, the transformation we were hoping to document can be seen as an organic design process that was simply pushed by time. As people from different eras had different 
                materials and demands, they gradually adapted tradition to their temporalities. It was important for us to leverage our particular technological moment and represent this with appropriate abstraction.

              <p>
                Because the chinese language consists approximately 50,000 characters, we decided to focus on the evolution of a single character. The character "mǎ" (pinyin) or 马 (simplified) means horse. It also has evolved into 吗 which is one of the most common words used in Chinese language when you ask a question.
                Below you can see the reshaping of the character mǎ.

              <p>
                We knew we wanted to provide an educational experience that directly interacted with users, since that’s the best way to make an idea stick. We created a manual that 
                included instructions for users to simulate separate experiences of interaction with character mǎ at different points in time. For example, an early Oracle Bone script 
                simulation would instruct users to actually try to carve into a piece of acrylic or stone.

              <p>However, we got feedback from our professors and graduate students of Architecture that 
                our design was not doing the infinitely elegant and natural transformation of the Chinese language justice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our focus to make the experience educational turned out too didactic (i.e. instructions, book) 
                and the act of simulating the various stages of the written character was too rigorous and complicated for the users.
              </p>
              <p>The final product had to be simpler.</p>

              <p>
                We took another look at the actual characters and narrowed to 7 stages of transformation. We realized that when you simply lay them next to each other, the lineage is extremely self-explanatory and linear 
                to tell their own story. We did not need a wordy and convoluted manual.
              </p>
              <span class="feature-title">Final Idea: Mǎ Puzzle Set</span>
              <p>
                However, it was still not enough to just lay them out in 2D. We finally decided that a “puzzle set” would allow the user to internalize the shape, strokes, and overall structure of each character 
                as they put the pieces together. The delicateness of the pieces were an intentional design decision, as it prompts the user to carefully separate the shapes out from each other and have an 
                opportunity to look and distinguish the forms from one another.

                We wanted to emphasize the role of technology in the exponential transformation of the Chinese characters. The old, poetic act of calligraphy to the automated process we encounter today 
                undoubtedly creates a jarring contrast. Our decision to choose laser cutting as our method of design and paper as our medium combines the digital and analog experience.
